I don't like to work with libs or frameworks because I'm so lazy to learn them. Also many libs or frameworks are low-customizable and it's so hard to make
them look alongside with my design.

I've decide to make my own UI framework which is as customizable as possible. Except it, my framework is splitted up to several NPM-modules. You download and use only you just need.

## Features

* This is ReactJS framework. Every framework module is a ReactJS typed component;
* Every module contains minimal CSS styles to be more customizable. You can provide your own CSS styles to make component look like you want. In some cases, you can provide CSS variables;
* You use only just you need. Every thing like popup, loading-wheel, datepicker is a separated NPM module. Your project bundle contains only neccessary code and is not overloaded;
* Dark theme support
