# Get Started

Congritta UI is projected so that you use only it as ui framework in your project.

Congritta UI works with React. Your project needs to be built with ReactJS 

## Preparing

Congritta UI is separated to several NPM modules. Every one of them requires `@congritta-ui/base` to be installed. So install it:

```shell
yarn add @congritta/base
```

and import it once to your project entry point file (that file where `ReactDOM.render` or `ReactDOM.createRoot`)

## Customizing

Read [@congritta-ui/base](./base) docs

## Let's decide what you need

Explore existing Congritta UI libs. After few months new ones will be there:

* [@congritta-ui/modal-window](./modal-window)
* [@congritta-ui/loading-wheel](./loading-wheel)
